        <h2>Consultation-</h2>
        <p>A walk through, inside and out, with the homeowner. I provide a thorough assessment of the property with recommendations and suggestions provided. Consideration is given to the time line and budget, money-saving tips are my specialty!</p>
        <h2>Occupied Staging-</h2>
        <p>During a preview appointment, I prepare the homeowner for what to expect on staging day and give them recommendations on what needs to be completed prior to staging day. I use the homeowners furnishings and decor to highlight the assets of the home. Stagings typically take 3-4 hours and the home is ready for listing photos that afternoon.
            We will work with the homeowner to eliminate distractions so potential buyers can picture themselves living in this home. We help sellers get a head start on their move and to mentally begin to prepare for the sale of the property. Using these services will allow your listing to stand out from other properties in the same price range.
            A staged home is a well presented property, ready for listing photos and showings.</p>
        <p> 95% of ASP staged homes sell on average of 11 days or less and sell for 17% more.</p>
